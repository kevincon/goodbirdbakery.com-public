 of apple). I started baking as a teenager and soon took over making cookies and
 cakes for our family's
 celebrations.<p class=lead>My love of baking blossomed into a passionate hobby after college.<p>I studied music at San Francisco State University and worked as a barista and an
 office assistant after graduating.
 The COVID-19 pandemic led me to become a homemaker, and baking became a way for
 me to
 share some joy with family, friends, and local businesses in a difficult time.<p class=lead>Positive feedback from the community encouraged me to start selling
 my baked goods.<p>I have been overwhelmed by the support from everyone who has tried my baked
 goods. Their interest inspired me to start this cottage bakery business.<p class=lead>Outside of baking...<p>In my spare time, I volunteer at the animal shelter, practice water
 coloring, and watch birds with my husband. I especially enjoy seeing our local

My husband and I enjoy bird watching, and the name was inspired by our admiration for the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow-billed_magpie target=_blank>yellow-billed magpie</a>:
<br><br>
<img class="img-fluid rounded" width=400px alt="Picture of a yellow-billed magpie" src=/magpie.3fb07b0d.jpg>
<br><br>
This curious corvid is only found in one place in the entire world: where we live in California's Central Valley.
<br><br>
Magpies are often misunderstood for being mischevious or even aggressive birds, but they're actually extremely intelligent, social, and protective.
<br><br>
We think the yellow-billed magpie is great, and we often tell each other, <span class=brand>"be a good bird..."</span> like the yellow-billed magpie! ☺️
</div><div class="border mb-0 p-3 rounded text-center"><strong class=fs-4>What other bakeries do you recommend?</strong><p class=pt-3>
<a href=https://palettecakes.com>Palette Cakes</a>: A beautiful bakery run by the most kind folks you'll ever meet! They create beautiful cakes with perfect flavor pairings and their pastries are delightful! They have a delicious cornflake cookie but we would also recommend trying their seasonal cupcakes!
<br><br>
<a href=https://cafetwig.com>Cafe Twig</a>: If you're wanting more cookie variety, check out Cafe Twig! Big flavors fit into big cookies! Although we like anything from Cafe Twig, we especially love her “Death by Whoopie” Cookies!
<br><br>
<a href=https://www.hotplate.com/strawberriesfabulous>Strawberries Fabulous</a>: Craving hot fluffy cinnamon rolls? Then Strawberries Fabulous is a must try! They are perfectly baked and topped with some of the best buttercreams and glazes I've seen! The Orange Blossom glaze is perfectly citrusy, but if you want a bigger bite, you've got to try the Vanilla Buttercream!
<br><br>
<a href=https://fariabakery.com>Faria Bakery</a>: They have an incredible selection of whole grain and sourdough breads, beautifully decorated cake slices, and other wonderful seasonal baked goods! They also provide baking classes which I would highly recommend, especially to those who want to try new things but might feel overwhelmed to try it alone. Their coffee cake is fantastic and I always try to grab whatever seasonal pastry they offer!
<br><br>
<a href=https://www.moonbellybakery.com>Moonbelly Bakery</a>: I would recommend coming to this bakery early in the day as they are quite popular! They offer wonderfully flaky croissants, seasonal danishes, and yummy savory breakfast pastries. I love that they highlight local musicians, and they often have folks playing outside. If you're able to go, the seasonal danish is a great pastry to try!
